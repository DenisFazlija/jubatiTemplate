# Database Optimization Recommendations

## Schema Optimizations

Several optimizations have been applied to the database schema:

1. Added an index on the `email` field in the `customer` table to improve customer lookup by email.
2. Added an index on the `service` field in the `service` table to improve service name searches.
3. Enhanced appointment table indexing with an additional single-column index on `date`.
4. Organized indexes in the `appointmentTable` with clear comments on their usage.

## Query Optimizations

### General Principles

1. **Use Batch Queries**: Continue to batch related queries together for network efficiency with Cloudflare D1.
2. **Index-Aware Query Order**: Structure queries to take advantage of available indexes, especially in WHERE clauses.
3. **Select Only Needed Fields**: In time-slots API, optimized to return only needed fields for appointments.
4. **Join Order**: Use the smallest tables first or tables with the most specific filtering.
5. **Filter Pushdown**: Apply filters as early as possible in query chains.

### File-Specific Optimizations

#### `/src/routes/checkAppointmentOverlap.ts`
- Added comments to clarify how the query uses the `appointment_employee_date_time_idx` index
- Organized WHERE conditions to match index columns (employeeId, date, time_from, time_to)

#### `/src/routes/api/time-slots/+server.ts`
- Optimized queries to select only needed fields from appointments
- Added clear comments about index usage
- Optimized filtering by employee ID before applying time checks

#### `/src/routes/admin/calendar/+page.server.ts`
- Improved join order and commented on index usage in appointment queries
- Arranged joins to utilize indexes: customer (appointment_customer_id_idx), service (appointment_service_id_idx)

#### `/src/routes/admin/+page.server.ts`
- Added comments about deletion order and dependency management
- Clarified index usage in batch operations
- Optimized join between employee and shift tables

#### `/src/routes/+page.server.ts`
- Used comments to clarify primary key lookup

## Performance Tips

1. **Index Usage**: The queries now take better advantage of the indexes defined in the schema
2. **Batch Operations**: Continue batching multiple inserts/updates when possible
3. **Dependency Ordering**: Delete records in proper dependency order (child records first, then parents)
4. **Minimize Data Transfer**: Select only the fields needed for each operation

These optimizations maintain the existing application logic while improving database query efficiency.
